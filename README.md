Introduction

The stock market is a crucial aspect of the economy, influencing the financial well-being of individuals, businesses, and governments. Predicting stock market trends is a challenging task due to the complexity of the stock market, the large number of variables involved, and the unpredictable nature of human behavior.

The objective of this project is to use machine learning techniques to predict the near-future trends of the stock market. The project seeks to gain understanding into the future movements of the stock market by utilizing technical indicators as features and binary target values indicating the rise or fall of stock prices within a determined time frame.

Data Collection and Preprocessing

In this project, stock market data was collected from a publicly available dataset. The data was preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and to prepare the data for the machine learning models.

Model Development

Several machine learning models were developed in this project to make predictions on the stock market trends. The models used include Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting and a XGBoost.

Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results showed that the ensemble model, which combined the predictions of all the models, performed the best in terms of accuracy and F1-score.

Conclusion

In conclusion, this project attempts to demonstrate the effectiveness of using machine learning techniques to predict the near-future trends of the S&P 500. The results of the study attempts to provide valuable insights into the stock market and is intented to be used to inform investment decisions. It is important to note that while the results of this project are better than expected, they are not a guarantee of future stock market performance. Further research is needed to improve the accuracy of the models and to extend the study to cover a longer time frame.
